  Today we're finally starting to work on answering the question...is it worthwhile 
  to send cards in for Beckett Graded Card Reviews (GCR)? We go over our results, show you some stats, and 
  give our review of using the service, including ways Beckett can improve it moving forward.
response_to_questions: >
  1. The cards are collectible cards for the One Piece (TCG) card game.
  2. The important metrics are percentages of cards with a grade bump and overall value increase
  3. The primary audience is card collectors/hobbyists who like to grade their cards
  4. For improvements, Mike and Tasha suggest that Becket greatly improve its transparency
